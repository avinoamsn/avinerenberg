# My personal site

The *package-lock.json* contains all the necessary info for installing the modules I use for development. All of my tooling is done through npm (check *package.json* for more info). The *.old* directory contains an earlier site (read: not great).

## Running locally

1. Install *browser-sync*: `npm install browser-sync`.
2. `npm run serve` on the command line. (Other commands can be found in *package.json*.)
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your preferred browser.
