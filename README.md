# My personal site

The *package-lock.json* contains all the necessary info for installing the npm modules I use. All of my tooling is done through npm (check *package.json* for more info). The *.old* directory contains an earlier site (read: not great).

## Running locally

1. Install all npm modules.
2. `npm run watch` on the command line. (Other commands can be found in *package.json*.)
